# Poster Presentations

*If you got here through scanning a QR code on a poster, you'll need to press "view code" above to actually see our files*

This repository is to store the finished posters presented by members of the Kid Neuro Lab at Carnegie Mellon University, headed by Prof. Jessica Cantlon. The folder structure follows this format: [YEAR]\_[EVENT]\_[LOCATION]. Inside each overarching folder will be a separate folder for each poster presented at that event; the folder will be named after a shortened version of the title. 

For every poster, there will always be the following files:

* A pdf of the presented poster
* A markdown file of the text on the folder
  * We will attempt to include image descriptions in this as well
* The images used for the poster

Additional resources may be included depending on feasibility and presenter preference:

* The cleaned, anonymous data used for the poster (usually in csv format)
  * This should be accompanied by an explanation of the data (which might be included in the analysis document)
* Analysis documents  that goes over how we calculated the results for the poster and made our plots (e.g. an Rmarkdown file output).

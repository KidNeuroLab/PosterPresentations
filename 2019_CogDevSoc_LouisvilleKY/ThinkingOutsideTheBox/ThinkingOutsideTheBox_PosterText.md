**Thinking outside the box: children’s understanding of geometrical rules is not rooted in shapes.**

*Marie Amalric, Nour Al-Zaghloul, Jessica Cantlon*

While geometry seems to be part of the human core knowledge, still little is known on how the human brain learns geometrical concepts. A previous study assessing adults’ and preschoolers’ comprehension of geometrical spatial sequences built on an octagon, exhibited a putative “language of thought” for geometry. This “language” made of primitive and combinatorial rules seemed to develop with age and education. Rotational symmetry and 3-level embeddings were particularly challenging for preschoolers and uneducated adults. In the present experiment, we proposed a short intervention to try and mitigate preschoolers’ potential limitation to perceive regularities in sequences using 3-level embedding. We chose a sequence dynamically drawing two perpendicular rectangles and tested whether explicit teaching and labeling of the corresponding static shape (i.e. rectangles) would help children to chunk the sequence. We compared with sequences drawing geometrical shapes that were not taught during the intervention (circle, squares, and crosses), and with a fully irregular sequence. We confirmed that preschoolers identify better than chance sequences using rotations, axial symmetries, and up to 2-level embeddings. However, the explicit knowledge of geometrical shapes did not help them to identify 3-level embeddings. This result tends to show that preschoolers’ difficulties do not come from spatial memory span limitations, but from a yet incomplete “language of geometry”.

### Introduction

While geometry seems to be part of the human core knowledge, still little is known on how the human brain learns geometrical concepts. A previous study assessing adults’ and preschoolers’ comprehension of geometrical spatial sequences built on an octagon, exhibited a putative “language of thought” for geometry. This “language” made of primitive and combinatorial rules seemed to develop with age and education. Rotational symmetry and 3-level embeddings were particularly challenging for preschoolers and uneducated adults. In the present experiment, we proposed a short intervention to try and mitigate preschoolers’ potential limitation to perceive regularities in sequences using 3-level embedding.

### Methods and Behavioral Results

*Descriptions of our methods and behavioral results are below. For a more detailed look at our results and how we analyzed our data, please check out our Data_Analysis folder and the html file within.*

#### Methods:

* 36 Children between the ages of of 3.5-6.17 years (mean = 4.89, median = 5)
* 2 Sessions, each lasting approximately 16 minutes
  * Session 1 was our "Geometric Sequences" task
  * Session 2 had additional batteries:
    * Visual-spatial working memory tasks from the *Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence* (WPPSI-4) (Zoo Locations and Picture Memory tasks)
    * Number knowledge tasks (Counting, *How Many?*, and *Give-N* tasks)

#### Behavioral Results:

Exclusions:

* 3 Children did not attend session 2 and so were excluded from analysis of working memory effects
* If a child has missed 3 or more locations in a sequence during a trial block, the data from that sequence is excluded
* If a child has missed 2 or more of the same sequence throughout the experiment, that sequence is excluded from analysis for that child

### Conclusions

* Preschoolers identified better than chance sequences using rotations, axial symmetries, and up to 2-level embeddings. 

* The explicit knowledge of geometrical shapes did not help them to identify 3-level embeddings. 

* Preschoolers’ difficulties do not come from spatial memory span limitations, but from a yet incomplete “language of geometry”.
